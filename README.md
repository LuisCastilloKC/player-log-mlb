# Player Log MLB
Welcome to my Baseball Player Log I hope you can enjoy it.

# Description
This application renders a single page on a web browser and fetches data from a backend rails API. The user is able to create a team name where it will be post on a left size of the body of the page. The user can then submit single player to the team already created. The user is able to destroy any thing with the delete button next to the team name.

# Installation
In your terminal and in the backend directory, run "$ bundle install" to download and install all the supporting gems. Then, while still in the backend directory, run "$ rails server". Then, feel free to open the index.html file on Google Chrome and begin using the app.
